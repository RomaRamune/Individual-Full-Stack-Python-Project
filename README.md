Individual Full-Stack with Python Project // Django // Dream wardrobe

# Introduction
My husband has ‚Äúgold‚Äù hands. He made all wardrobes in our apartment. Therefore I thought that it would be great to have a representing web page where we could add his completed wardrobes as examples and let clients to order the ones they would like to have at their home as well.
The aim was to upload all real life examples we have and let clients to order the ones they want. 
Also, as these would be custom projects, the free text field was added to every order for the client to add any ideas, requests, comments he/she has.
The next step would be for the admin of the site to reach out to client and make a visit to their home, make the drawing, calculations and then add the preliminary due date, when the wardrobe could be completed.
There is also a possibility to see how many times that kind of wardrobe was ordered.
Client also can leave feedback for the others to see.
There is also a possibility for the client to update or delete the order.
Not registered users can see the example of wardrobes with feedbacks (if any) and colours we currently offer, but only registered users can leave new feedbacks, request/amend/delete orders and see their orders.

# Getting Started
Download the code from GitHub, get the virtual environment up and running and then install the requirements from requirements.txt. Please also makemigrations and migrate before you run the server.

# Use
Review the site, register and order if you like something üòä 
Also do not forget to leave feedback after the request is completed.
